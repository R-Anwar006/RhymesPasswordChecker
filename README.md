# RhymesPasswordChecker

Hi Professor Wood,

  This is my final project for CISS100. I wanted to make a website that checks your password for it's strength and I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the website. I added factors in such as inclusion of capital letters, lower case letters, symbols, and other factors that determine whether the password is strong or not. I also added in a password generator that generates a password with a mix of all the strengthening factors that make a password strong into a password ready for you to copy.
